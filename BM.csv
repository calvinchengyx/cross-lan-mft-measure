在海外留学期间，家里人一直很关心我的身体健康。特别是临近学期末学习压力大的时候，他们总会给我打电话。在通话中他们会叮嘱我要多去锻炼身体，运动解压。长平之战，秦军受降了数十万赵军。但在权衡利弊之后，秦军决定残忍地坑杀这些降卒。最终战俘均被处决，只有两百多名赵国士卒生还。,scenario,cz,care,"While studying abroad, my family has always been concerned about my health.

我已经一个星期没见到住在隔壁的友善的阿姨了。今天她终于回来，于是我问她去哪儿了。她说上个星期她的新冠检测呈阳性。虽然现在新加坡已经不要求阳性患者强制隔离，但是因为她跟女儿生活在一起，担心病毒传染给女儿和邻居，所以她自愿选择去朋友家隔离了一个星期，直到新冠检测转阴才回来。我们都因她的付出免于受到感染。广西的一条高速公路上，一个男人目睹了一场车祸并迅速救出车中的两人，但因车门难以打开和车辆起火，来不及救出第三位乘客。当这起事件的视频被人发布到网上之后，某些网友对他的救援行动挑刺，指责他没有采取有效的方法，救援不及时，导致第三名乘客死亡。这让本就内疚不已的他更加痛苦。,scenario,cz,care,"I haven't seen my friendly aunt who lives next door for a week. Today she finally came back, so I asked her where she was. She said she tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Although Singapore no longer requires positive patients to be quarantined compulsorily, because she lived with her daughter and was worried about transmitting the virus to her daughter and neighbors, she voluntarily chose to quarantine at a friend's house for a week until the new coronavirus test turned negative. We are all protected from infection because of her efforts. On a highway in Guangxi, a man witnessed a car accident and quickly rescued two people in the car, but was too late to rescue the third passenger because the door was difficult to open and the vehicle caught fire. After the video of the incident was posted online, some netizens criticized his rescue operations, accusing him of not taking effective measures and not responding in time, resulting in the death of the third passenger. This made him feel even more guilty.",BM_CS

From time to time, they take me to participate in department group activities, meet new colleagues, and help me answer questions I don’t understand at work.

I felt that it was uncomfortable, so I squatted down and scratched it. Then it kept following me, making eye contact with me, suggesting that I wanted to help it. Jack was eating with a group of people. John felt that Jack was not the same person as him, so he ostracized Jack in every possible way, hoping that he would not participate in such activities.

虽然不在一个城市，但是我的朋友总是会时不时打电话给我聊聊最新情况。当我选择未来道路时，他格外认真地陪我长谈了两个小时。这次使我了解了更多相关情况，并且增进了我们的友谊。韩国军政府派出了空降部队镇压学生的游行，但是学生不愿解散。军政府首脑：连空降部队都不怕，这明显全都是暴徒！不要再犹豫了，一定要出重拳！于是军队武力清场，逮捕和杀害了几百名学生。,scenario,cz,care,"Although we are not in the same city, my friends always call me from time to time to talk about the latest situation. When I was choosing my future path, he stayed with me for two hours in a very serious conversation. This time I learned more about the situation and enhanced our friendship. The South Korean military government sent airborne troops to suppress the student demonstrations, but the students refused to disperse. Head of the military government: Not even the airborne troops are afraid, these are obviously thugs! Don't hesitate any more, be sure to hit hard! So the army cleared the area by force, arresting and killing hundreds of students.",BM_CS
在家庭聚会上，我见到了叔叔的小女儿，她才6岁，瘦瘦小小的。在饭桌上，她还不太会用筷子，我便给她夹了一些她爱吃的菜，她特别喜欢吃可乐鸡翅，我就多给她夹了几个，希望她能多吃点长的高高的。我告诉她我也很喜欢吃可乐鸡翅，我们瞬间开启了共同话题，愉快的聊了起来。这几天看闺蜜闷闷不乐，我就主动找她聊天，结果得知她男朋友跟她提了分手，并且将她从同居的房子里赶了出去。原来早在一个月前，她男朋友就对她冷暴力，她不能忍受这种冷漠，多次想跟她男朋友好好沟通，但都被她男朋友拒绝了。我很气愤，我认为情侣之间存在什么问题都应该多沟通，而不是这样冷暴力，还非常不绅士的把我闺蜜赶出家门。现在除了能多陪陪她，我好像什么都做不了。,scenario,cz,care,"At a family gathering, I met my uncle’s little daughter. She was only 6 years old, thin and small. At the dinner table, she was not very good at using chopsticks, so I gave her some of her favorite dishes. She especially liked Coke chicken wings, so I gave her a few more, hoping she could eat more. High. I told her that I also like to eat Coke chicken wings, and we immediately started a common topic and started chatting happily. Seeing that my best friend was unhappy these days, I took the initiative to chat with her, and found out that her boyfriend broke up with her and kicked her out of the house we lived with. It turned out that as early as a month ago, her boyfriend had been cold and violent towards her. She could not bear this indifference. She tried to communicate with her boyfriend many times, but she was rejected by her boyfriend. I was very angry. I think couples should communicate more about any problems they have, instead of being so cold and violent, and driving my best friend out of the house in a very ungentlemanly manner.

商鞅在秦孝公支持下于秦国实施变法。权贵阶层虽然利益受损，但屈从于秦孝公的权威，大都不敢正面对抗变法。最终新法在秦国得以实施。因担心延误戍边日期而被处罚的陈胜吴广，在大泽乡决定起义反秦。在“王侯将相宁有种乎”的呼声中，戍卒纷纷响应。这场农民起义吹响了反抗秦统治的号角。,scenario,cz,auth,"Shang Yang implemented reforms in Qin with the support of Qin Xiaogong. Although the interests of the powerful class were harmed, they succumbed to the authority of Qin Xiaogong and most of them did not dare to confront the reform. Eventually the new law was implemented in Qin. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, who were worried about being punished for delaying the border guarding date, decided to revolt against Qin in Daze Township. In response to the call of ""Princes, generals, prime ministers, etc., do you have the right to live in peace?"", the garrison soldiers responded one after another.

生物实验室的同学严格按照导师的要求，每天早上8点半之前到达实验室打卡签到，完成超过12个小时的实验操作，直到晚上10点才回到寝室休息，只有周日才被准许放假。但是很多同学仍然选择在周日继续工作。许多00后进入职场之后，不愿加班，并且要求周末双休。同时，如果上司通过威胁克扣工资、开除等方式进行逼迫，那么他们就会利用劳动法来捍卫自己的权利，不惜与其打官司。这让习惯了以往职场氛围的80后90后领导非常苦恼。,scenario,cz,auth,"Students in the biology laboratory strictly followed the instructor's requirements, arriving at the laboratory to check in before 8:30 every morning, completing more than 12 hours of experimental operations, and did not return to the dormitory to rest until 10 p.m. They were only allowed to have holidays on Sundays. But many students still choose to continue working on Sunday. After many post-00s entered the workplace, they were unwilling to work overtime and required weekends off. At the same time, if the boss threatens to withhold wages, fire, etc., then they will use labor laws to defend their rights and will not hesitate to file a lawsuit with them. This makes leaders born in the 1980s and 1990s who are accustomed to the previous workplace atmosphere very distressed.",BM_CS
每年最担心的就是回老家见长辈。他们一个个不识字还要对你的个人生活指手画脚，作为晚辈还不能顶撞他们。人们常说要尊老爱幼，为什么就不能说尊老尊幼。总统府的举动引起了大批乌克兰市民反抗。许多被征兵家属聚集在征兵办公室门口，强烈反对强制征兵法令。在乌克兰人民看来，这场俄乌冲突已经毫无意义。,scenario,cz,auth,"What I worry about most every year is going back to my hometown to meet my elders. They are all illiterate and still want to dictate your personal life. As a junior, you can't contradict them. People often say that we should respect the old and love the young, why can't we say respect the old and respect the young.

It is said that the National Health Commission immediately closed the city without any advance notice or preparation. Everyone must be obedient. It is particularly inconvenient for everyone to stay at home now. Shanghai has been closed for too long. I heard that some communities have food supply problems, and many grassroots communities are seeking private ownership.

虽然觉得学院副院长的很多教学计划都不合理，需要更改。但是我还是没有提出意见，因为担心提出意见会让老师们觉得自己太难搞，以后不愿意帮忙学生。所以最后只能服从现有的教学计划。被科技公司管理的克隆人因为发现自己的存在是为了服务外面的有钱人用来器官移植。为了争取生存权利，克隆人发起了反抗，推翻了公司对他们的管理，全部逃跑。,scenario,cz,auth,"Although I feel that many of the teaching plans of the deputy dean of the college are unreasonable and need to be changed. But I still didn't raise my opinion because I was worried that raising my opinion would make the teachers feel that I was too difficult and would not want to help students in the future. So in the end we can only obey the existing teaching plan. The clones managed by technology companies discovered that their existence was to serve wealthy people outside and use them for organ transplants. In order to fight for the right to survive, the clones launched a rebellion, overthrew the company's management of them, and all escaped.",BM_CS
中医药是老祖宗留下来的瑰宝，治愈中国人五千年。我们要用心尊重并传承。我们全家求医问药都是去找老中医，很少去西医院。在被镇压以后，学生们中流传着一首反抗军政府的歌曲：爱也好名誉也好，终究会随风飘逝。一生坚持的信仰，激昂义愤的盟誓。同志们献身大义，旗帜依旧在飘扬。新世界到来之前，我们绝不会放弃。,scenario,cz,auth,"Traditional Chinese medicine is a treasure left by our ancestors and has cured the Chinese people for five thousand years. We must respect and pass it on with all our heart. When our family seeks medical advice, we always go to traditional Chinese medicine doctors and rarely go to Western hospitals. After the crackdown, a song circulated among students to resist the military government: Love and reputation will eventually drift away. Believe that you persist in throughout your life, and make an oath that inspires righteous indignation. Comrades dedicated their lives to the cause, and the flag is still flying. We will never give up until the new world comes.",BM_CS
在确定读博的研究方向前，其实我迷茫过一段时间。在这段时间里，我咨询了我的硕士导师，他给了我一些不错的建议，比如:要从小的研究点切入，不要好高骛远。除此之外，他还一直在开导我，对我进行心理疏导。我很感谢他，他的很多话都鼓舞了我，让我不再困惑和迷茫。今年四月有上千名储户合计超过12亿的存款无法取出，这些储户有一个共同点，他们都是在相同的5家银行办理了储蓄业务。新闻爆出后，自然也让相关的其他储户心里亮起了警灯，结果所有人都无法正常取款，很多储户不得已便去银行门口聚集反抗，以此来维护他们的权益。最后，经统计有397亿存款不翼而飞，这些储户仍在用各种方式上访、投诉，以追回自己的存款。,scenario,cz,auth,"Before deciding on the research direction for my Ph.D., I was actually confused for a while. During this time, I consulted my master's tutor, and he gave me some good advice, such as: start with small research points and don't aim too high. In addition, he has been enlightening me and providing me with psychological counseling. I am very grateful to him. Many of his words inspired me and made me no longer confused and confused. In April this year, thousands of depositors were unable to withdraw more than 1.2 billion in deposits. These depositors have one thing in common. They all handled savings business at the same five banks. After the news broke, other related depositors naturally turned on their warning lights. As a result, no one could withdraw money normally. Many depositors had no choice but to gather in front of the bank to resist in order to protect their rights and interests. In the end, according to statistics, 39.7 billion in deposits disappeared, and these depositors are still petitioning and complaining in various ways to recover their deposits.",BM_CS

王老师是一个科研管理领域的研究者。不同于其他的同僚总是在验证政府提出的科学管理政策的可行性和有效性，或只是在既有政策上做一些锦上添花的表面性修饰，他的研究目标在于通过研究科研产出、科研合作、科研经费流动的实证数据来揭露和抵制学术界的学阀和学术资源垄断行为，从而促进科研管理制度的公平性改革。近年来，越来越多真正做研究的学者尤其是青年学者争取到了更多的资源和支持。富兰克林置办了一身行头，都是一些仿冒的名牌衣服和鞋子，还租了一辆豪车。随后他找人帮他拍了一组他身穿假名牌，开着豪车的照片，并将这些照片发布到推特上。由于没法通过照片判断真假，许多人都以为富兰克林很有钱，也愿意借钱给富兰克林。,scenario,cz,fair,"Teacher Wang is a researcher in the field of scientific research management.

剧组在零下10度的室外拍摄。间歇期间，导演亲自为主演披上剧组特意准备的棉大衣。主演看到后赶忙拒绝说，除非片场的每一位演员都披上棉大衣，否则他不愿被特殊对待。今天去菜市场买苹果。老板大方地承认说自己的称是八两秤。买了一斤水果，结账时多放了两个苹果说要足够斤两。我回到家中重新称了一下，发现实际总重量只有六两，被人欺骗了，还在夸老板实诚，真是傻。,scenario,cz,fair,"The crew filmed outdoors at minus 10 degrees Celsius. During the interval, the director personally put on the leading actor a cotton coat specially prepared by the crew. After seeing this, the lead actor quickly refused and said that he did not want to be treated specially unless every actor on the set wore a cotton coat.

北京市的汽车车牌需要公开摇号，大家很难拿到一个新车牌。我参加了摇号，公平地与其他人竞争。但是没摇到。富豪女儿因为虚荣心作祟，将自己伪装成一个高科技人才，创造了一滴血检测所有疾病的概念，获得大量投资。但是最后证明这个概念是假的，她受到应有的惩罚。,scenario,cz,fair,"Car license plates in Beijing require a public lottery, making it difficult for everyone to get a new license plate. I entered the lottery and competed fairly against everyone else. But it didn't shake. Out of vanity, the rich man's daughter disguised herself as a high-tech talent, created the concept of detecting all diseases with a drop of blood, and received a large amount of investment. But this concept turned out to be false and she was duly punished.",BM_CS
制定法律以及执行法律本身，就是为了社会能够有道理可讲，有理就要有有说理的地方，所以，法院就是让人们有道理可讲的地方。所有的法律人的职业属性就是维护社会的公平正义的。如果法律人不把公平正义作为出发点和归宿点，那法律不过是一些人打压愚弄另外一些人的工具而已。我们手上有紧俏的房源，想租的人很多。市场供给需求不匹配激发了我们的贪欲。为了利润最大化，我们让想租的人彼此竞价，并虚构出高价的对手。最终，我们成功向租户加了20%的租金。,scenario,cz,fair,"The purpose of formulating laws and enforcing laws is to allow society to have reasons to speak out. To be justified, there must be a place for reasoning. Therefore, the court is a place where people can make sense and speak out. The professional attribute of all legal professionals is to maintain social fairness and justice. If legal practitioners do not take fairness and justice as their starting point and destination, then the law is just a tool for some people to suppress and fool others. We have a tight supply of housing and many people want to rent it. The mismatch between market supply and demand inspires our greed. To maximize profits, we let would-be renters bid against each other and create fictional high-bidding rivals. In the end, we successfully increased the rent to the tenants by 20%.",BM_CS
我想6月是属于高考生们的大日子，高考是每个学子一生中都难以忘记的记忆。高考是学生们进入大学必须要经历的，也是最公正公平的考试。在中国，如果想进入高等学府，就必须通过高考达到一定的分数线，才有可能被录取。一年一次，高考的规模和严格程度，让经历过的人都铭记心中。在我读大学的时候，同寝室的室友经历过网络欺骗，虽然没有金钱上的损失，但她损失了宝贵的时间。那段时间她想找兼职赚点钱，就在网上找了个网络主播的工作，结果对方骗她直播完一个月就消失不见了。她很生气，但又没办法报警，只能告诫自己以后小心点，天上不会掉馅饼的。,scenario,cz,fair,"I think June is a big day for college entrance examination students. The college entrance examination is an unforgettable memory in every student's life. The college entrance examination is a must for students to enter university, and it is also the most fair and fair examination. In China, if you want to enter an institution of higher learning, you must pass the college entrance examination and reach a certain score before you can be admitted. Once a year, the scale and rigor of the college entrance examination are engraved in the hearts of those who have experienced it. When I was in college, my roommate experienced online fraud. Although she did not lose money, she lost valuable time. During that time, she wanted to find a part-time job to make some money, so she found a job as a network anchor online. However, the other party deceived her into live broadcasting for a month and then disappeared. She was very angry, but she had no way to call the police.

安东尼不服，决定去拜访康德比。康德比回答：“我也不知道，我只不过是一个鞋匠而已。每次修鞋的时候，我总是将它当做上帝的鞋子来修理。平时，我也是用这种方式来为别人服务的。”安东尼似有所悟。原来，所谓的圣洁，不在于自身的修养有多么好，而在于把这种高贵的品质用在对待别上人。,scenario,cz,sanc,"Anthony was dissatisfied and decided to visit Condeby. Conderby replied: ""I don't know, I'm just a shoemaker. Every time I repair shoes, I always repair them as God's shoes.

妈祖，中国古代神话中的海神，又称天后、天上圣母等等 ，是历代船工、海员、旅客、商人和渔民共同信奉的神祇，祈求保佑顺风和安全。20世纪80年代，联合国有关机构授予妈祖“和平女神”称号。目前，全世界共有上万座从湄洲祖庙分灵的妈祖庙，有3亿多人信仰妈祖。各妈祖庙都会举办各式各样的纪念活动。在《锦心似玉》中有这样一个人物——王煜，他是女人心中的恶魔，男人心中的恶棍，家人心中的负担。他真的是“臭名在外”，男人不愿意挨，女人不愿意嫁，就算有显赫的家世也抵挡不了他在另人心中恶魔般的存在。而他却还不自知，觉得自己并没有如此不堪，自己想要的东西还是信手拈来的。,scenario,cz,sanc,"Mazu, the sea god in ancient Chinese mythology, is also known as the Queen of Heaven, the Holy Mother of Heaven, etc. She is a deity believed by boatmen, sailors, travelers, merchants and fishermen of all ages to pray for smooth winds and safety.
